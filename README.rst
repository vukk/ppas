ppas - PostProcess Answer Sets
==============================

This program accepts clingo 4.x and clasp 3.x log files and an ASP script to
postprocess the answer sets the log contains.
The result is a rewritten log file.

Each answer is assigned a sequence number starting from 1 and it's atoms are
wrapped in the special predicate _as(Term, SequenceNum). The answer sets are
replaced with atoms read from a special predicate _pp(Term, SequenceNum).

E.g. adding the atom "a." to the first answer set in the log could be done with
the following ASP script::
	% Add "a." to first answer set / model
	_pp(a, 1).
	% Pass everything else through
	_pp(Term, SeqNum) :- _as(Term, SeqNum).

Note that the sequence number does not necessarily correspond to <num> in the
"Answer: <num>" line in the input log file; for example when multiple solve
calls were used.
